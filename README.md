# JCpad
### JCpad is a TodoMVC that I created during my development training; however, you can use it to create CTFs, simulate a basic application, and even for educational purposes. Be creative!!

#### NOTE: If you want to create the tables used in JCpad, uncomment the last line of the file "./Models/Database.php" and run "php ./Models/Database.php" to create them. Remember to update the variables "$admin_user" and "$admin_pass" in lines "9,10".
